# Project Approach, Challenges, Solutions, and Architecture

---

## Approach

The goal of this project is to provide users with actionable, AI-powered feedback on their LinkedIn profiles and to recommend job opportunities based on real market data. The application leverages Streamlit for the user interface, ScrapingDog for LinkedIn/job data extraction, and OpenAI-powered LLMs (via LangChain) for analysis, rewriting, and counseling.

**Key Steps:**
1. **User Input:** Collect user email, LinkedIn profile URL, and target job role.
2. **Data Extraction:** Use ScrapingDog API to fetch profile and job data.
3. **Job Market Analysis:** Aggregate and summarize job descriptions for the target role.
4. **AI Analysis:** Use LLMs to analyze the profile, compare it to job requirements, rewrite sections, and provide career counseling.
5. **Persistence:** Save and retrieve user results for repeat visits.

## Challenges & Solutions

### 1. **LinkedIn Data Extraction**
- **Challenge:** LinkedIn does not provide a public API for profile/job data, and scraping is non-trivial due to anti-bot measures.
- **Solution:** Integrated [ScrapingDog](https://www.scrapingdog.com/) API, which handles LinkedIn scraping and returns structured JSON data.

### 2. **Job Description Summarization**
- **Challenge:** Job postings are unstructured and vary widely in format and content.
- **Solution:** Fetched multiple job descriptions for the target role, then used an LLM prompt to deduplicate and standardize skills, responsibilities, and qualifications.

### 3. **Profile & Job Fit Analysis**
- **Challenge:** Comparing a user's profile to a job description requires nuanced understanding and contextual matching.
- **Solution:** Used prompt engineering with OpenAI models to generate a match score, identify gaps, and suggest improvements, leveraging LangChain for modular prompt management.

### 4. **Section Rewriting**
- **Challenge:** Rewriting LinkedIn sections to be concise, keyword-rich, and tailored to a job is a creative task.
- **Solution:** Designed prompts for the LLM to rewrite 'About', 'Experience', 'Skills', and 'Headline' sections, ensuring industry best practices and keyword integration.

### 5. **User Experience & Persistence**
- **Challenge:** Users may want to revisit previous analyses.
- **Solution:** Implemented result caching and retrieval by email, and used Streamlit's UI components for a smooth workflow.

## Architecture Explanation

### 1. **Frontend (Streamlit)**
- Collects user input and displays results.
- Provides buttons for analysis and loading previous results.
- Shows progress and organizes output into clear sections.

### 2. **Backend Logic**
- **`utils/scraper.py`:** Handles all API calls to ScrapingDog for profile and job data, and aggregates job descriptions.
- **`utils/llm_chain.py`:** Contains all LLM-based analysis, rewriting, and counseling logic, using LangChain for prompt management and stateful workflows.

### 3. **LLM Integration**
- Uses OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini via LangChain for:
  - Profile analysis
  - Job fit scoring and gap analysis
  - Section rewriting
  - Career counseling

### 4. **Persistence**
- Results are saved in a local JSON file keyed by user email.
- Previous results can be loaded and displayed.

### 5. **Environment & Security**
- Sensitive API keys are loaded from a `.env` file using `python-dotenv`.
- No keys are hardcoded in the source.
